          <h3 id="headline">Marketing Pitch:</h3>
          <li style="color:;"><strong> Our project is designed mainly to predict the compressive strength behaviour of concrete. Concrete being a base material for any construction, it is designed to provide a high range of mechanical and durability properties and to meet the design requirements of a concrete structure. The compressive strength of concrete is the most common property and the measure used by the engineer in designed buildings and other structures if the concrete is structurally acceptable or not. It is often necessary to test concrete structures after the concrete has hardened and to determine if the structure is suitable for its designed
            use.<br> <br>We, as an Engineers team, always works for Safer Buildings, which we always dreamt of. A key to protecting yourself during disasters is finding safe shelter, whether it be at home, work or school. To maximize your safety, we are here to construct the building to properly withstand a disaster, especially if the building is in a high-risk location, such as an area prone to hurricanes or near earthquake fault lines. It’s an important issue, as many disaster-related injuries and deaths can be prevented when buildings are engineered by us to weather a catastrophe.
            <br><br>There are been many testing methods to find out the compressive strength of Concrete, but we keeping a keen eye on determining its best compressive strength using the Machine learning models to predict
            the compressive strength of field concrete which is evaluated and compared to those models trained exclusively on field concrete data rather to laboratory concrete models. This analysis helps for building
            predictive models which is a promising method for reducing common over-prediction issues caused by laboratory concrete models, that are used in isolation. We as a team working hard to gain recognition on a large scale with this new technique as it provides contracting authorities with accurate and objective information for monitoring quality which is the control of concrete construction.

          <li><strong>1973</strong> - His research in Organic Chemistry led to the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) awarded by the University of Makerere, Kampala, in Uganda in October 1973.</li>
          <li><strong>1975</strong> - He went back to his home country where he started lecturing Organic Chemistry at the University of Yaounde where he got to the top of the possible achievements and rewards in his research area. He was the head of his department until his departure to be with the Lord whom he loved and served as a living testimony.</li>
          <li><strong>1975</strong> - At his arrival to Cameroon on May 12, 1975, he wrote the tract "How to Know Jesus Christ" and started preaching the Gospel in Yaounde. Many people believedto the Gospel he preached and that's how Christian Missionary Fellowship International was born as a movement which have over a million disciples  of the Lord Jesus and missionaries in over 100 nations in the 6 continents.</li>
          <li><strong>2005</strong> - His published scientific works were recently evaluated by the University of Durham in Great Britain and found to be research of high distinction, for which he was awarded the Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) in October 2005. As a Professor of Organic Chemistry in the University of Yaounde in Cameroon, Professor Zacharias Tanee Fomum supervised and co-supervised more than a 100 Master’s and Doctoral Degree theses and co-authored over 160 scientific articles in leading international journals. He considered scientific research as an act of obedience to God’s command to “subdue the earth” (Genesis 1:28). He also knew that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord of Science. “For by Him all things were created…” (Colossians 1:16). He made the Lord Jesus the Director of his research laboratory and he, Professor Fomum, took the place of deputy director. He attributed his scientific success to the revelational leadership of the Lord Jesus.</li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - On the 14th of March 2009, while Brother Zach was on his way to Bambili, a small town in the Northwest Province of Cameroon, he was called home by the Lord. He had finished his task. It was a glorious exit. He was called home from the battle field. We can truly say of Brother Zach that he fought the good fight, he finished his course and he kept the faith. Praise be to God for a life lived for the exclusive glory of the Lord!
